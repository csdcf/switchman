*** ROM Update Required! ***

BootROM requirement for K.15 software!

All switches must be running a BootROM version of
K.12.17 or newer in order to load K.15 software.

ProCurve 3500yl, 5400zl, 6200yl, and 8212zl switches
will need to be updated and running software version 
K.13.58 (BootROM K.12.17) or newer software before 
successfully loading K.15 software versions. 

This software includes an update to BootROM K.15.19.
If your switch has an older version of BootROM, the
BootROM will be updated with this K.15.06.xxxx software.

**Do not interrupt power to the switch during the update!!**


*** Configuration Compatibility Caution ***

If you enable some new features, the config file will
NOT be backward-compatible with older software versions.
Before updating to this new software version, be sure to
back up your current config file!

Please follow "Best Practices for Software Updates"
in the Basic Operation Guide for your switch.
